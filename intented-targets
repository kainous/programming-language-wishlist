# Intended Targets
In addition to being able to target applications written for various versions of modern operating systems and phones, the intention of this ecosystem is to target various
machine code instruction sets, from x86, x64, ARM, or even microcontrollers.

However, it's not just to write code that targets a specific instruction set, but also that can be used to target other subsystems, such as:
* A replacement for WASM (Web Assembly) where validation has occurred regarding security and is only allowed specific and isolated access to various hardware
* Database queries (for relational databases, graph databases, etc.) which are specifically type-checked and guarded for any transactions
* GPGPU instructions, which can be further targeted for the specific GPUs
* Quantum computing via Linear Types
* A linear langauge for describing valid communication sessions between client and server
* for generating FPGA, ASIC, PLC, and other PLD applications

A variation of the language that serves only as a data source would describe:
* application settings and programmable configurations accepting programmable blocks and iteration to prevent duplication
* infrastructure-as-code (IaC)
*
